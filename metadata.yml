Title: Digitization of molecular complexity
Description: This model uses a learning-to-rank machine learning framework to quantify
  molecular complexity in a supervised way. Based on Shapley value analysis, authors
  were able to identify molecular characteristics that guide experts in assigning
  molecular complexity, such as molecular weight or number of aromatic cycles. The
  model was developed using a dataset of ca. 300k data points across diverse structures,
  and it was applied to study trends in synthetic strategies, among other analyses.
